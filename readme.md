# newline

[Deno](https://deno.land/) command line tools for manipulating **newline**-delimited text data using modern JavaScript.

These tools, inspired by [ndjson-cli](https://github.com/mbostock/ndjson-cli),
allow you to modify, filter, validate, and reduce piped input streams of JSON and CSV, using [v8](https://v8.dev/features)'s powerful [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) engine.
